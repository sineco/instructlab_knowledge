Following the pope’s sudden death, 118 cardinals gather in the Vatican for a secret conclave. The main candidates include:

- Cardinal Bellini (USA, progressive)
- Cardinal Adeyemi (Nigeria, conservative)

Cardinal Lawrence leads the election process. He uncovers political scandals, blackmail, and secrets, including:

- A mysterious new cardinal, Benitez, appointed *in pectore*
- A past sexual relationship involving Adeyemi
- Bribery by Tremblay

After a series of deadlocks and a bombing in Europe, Benitez is unexpectedly elected pope and takes the name *Innocent*. Lawrence later learns Benitez is intersex and questions the implications of his election.
