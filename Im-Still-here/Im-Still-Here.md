# I'm Still Here

**I'm Still Here** is a 2024 political biographical drama film directed by Walter Salles from a screenplay by Murilo Hauser and Heitor Lorega, based on Marcelo Rubens Paiva's 2015 memoir of the same name. It stars Fernanda Torres and Fernanda Montenegro as Eunice Paiva, a mother and activist coping with the forced disappearance of her husband, the dissident politician Rubens Paiva (played by Selton Mello), during the military dictatorship in Brazil.

Soon after its release in Brazilian theaters on 7 November 2024 by Sony Pictures Releasing International, the film was the target of an unsuccessful boycott by the Brazilian far-right, which denies that the military regime was a dictatorship. Grossing $34 million, it became the highest-grossing Brazilian film since the COVID-19 pandemic.

The film had its world premiere on 1 September 2024 at the 81st Venice International Film Festival, where it received critical acclaim with unanimous praise towards Torres' performance, winning the Best Screenplay award. It was named one of the Top 5 International Films of 2024 by the National Board of Review.

At the 82nd Golden Globe Awards, Fernanda Torres won Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, and the film was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film, a category in which it was also nominated at the Critics' Choice Awards and the BAFTAs. At the 97th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Best Actress (Torres) and Best Picture, and it won Best International Feature Film, becoming the first-ever Brazilian produced film to win an Academy Award.

## Plot

In December 1970, Rubens Paiva lives in a house near Leblon beach with his wife Eunice and their five children. After losing his political office during the 1964 coup in Brazil, he secretly supports political expatriates. Following the kidnapping of the Swiss ambassador by revolutionary movements, the country is in political turmoil. Friends of the family flee to London, taking the Paivas' eldest daughter, Vera.

A military raid at their home leads to Rubens' arrest and disappearance in January 1971. Eunice is arrested and tortured for 12 days; their teenage daughter Eliana is also detained briefly. Eunice searches for answers, facing false reports claiming Rubens fled the country. Through legal efforts and support from friends, Eunice learns the truth of his death.

Years later, in 1996, Eunice receives Rubens' official death certificate and calls for justice. In 2014, now 85 and suffering from Alzheimer's disease, Eunice recalls her past upon hearing news of the National Truth Commission. Closing cards reveal Rubens' murder in 1971 and Eunice's accomplishments as a lawyer and Indigenous rights advocate. She died in 2018 at 89.
